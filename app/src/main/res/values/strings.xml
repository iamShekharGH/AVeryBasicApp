East of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moanin
Out this one-note song
You\'d think about the woman
Or the girl you knew the night before`
But your thoughts will soon be wanderin\'
The way they always do
When you\'re ridin\' 16 hours
There\'s nothin\' much to do
And you don\'t feel much like ridin\'
We just wish the trip was through
Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go playin\' the star again
There I go, turn the page
So you walk into this restaurant
All strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you\'re shakin\' off the cold
You pretend it doesn\'t bother you
But you just want to explode
Yeah, most times you can\'t hear \'em talk
        Other times you can
        All the same old clich√©s
        Is it woman? Is it man?
        And you always seem outnumbered
        You don\'t dare make a stand
        Make your stand
        Here I am, on the road again
        There I am, up on the stage
        Here I go playin\' the star again
        There I go, turn the page
        Out there in the spotlight
        You\'re a million miles away
        Every ounce of energy
        You try and give away
        As the sweat pours out your body
        Like the music that you play
        Later in the evenin\'
        As you lie awake in bed
        With the echoes of the amplifiers
        Ringin\' in your head
        You smoke the day\'s last cigarette
        Rememberin\' what she said
        What she said
        Yeah, and here I am, on the road again
        There I am, up on the stage
        Here I go playin\' the star again
        There I go, turn the page
        And there I go
        Turn that page
        There I go, yeah, yeah
        There I go, yeah, yeah
        Here I go, yeah
        Here I go, yeah
        There I go
        There I go
        And I\'m gone
